# Time_To_upgrade_To_web3.0
web3.0 modern application with blockchain ; smart contracts , react and node js

To build a modern web app ; let's say a Dapp ; according to Metamask :

For any non-trivial Ethereum web application — a.k.a. dapp, web3 site etc. — to work, you will have to:

    Detect the Ethereum provider (window.ethereum)
    Detect which Ethereum network the user is connected to
    Get the user's Ethereum account(s)


The provider API is all you need to create a full-featured web3 application.

That said, many developers use a convenience library, such as ethers
(opens new window), instead of using the provider directly. If you are in need of higher-level abstractions than those provided by this API, 
we recommend that you use a convenience library

Tools needed to build :

  Node providers : like Alchemy best known , Infura and more ...
  Smart contract : basic knowledge in solidity , rust or others
  Frontend and API :React ,Javascript 
  Currency worked with : Ethereum 
  Enviroment : Hardhat and its libraries , concerns only ethereum , blockchain
  
      "Easily deploy your contracts, run tests and debug Solidity code without dealing with live environments. 
        Hardhat Network is a local Ethereum network designed for development ."
        
  Wallet : MetaMask      
  Network : Ropsten , you can work with any network as much as you want 
  
  I have learnt so many things during this project ; Javascript Mastery + documentation for ech technology helped me together to build a big picture about web3.0 ;
